[14/08/24, 11:31:01 PM] Nsut Bhanvi  CSAI CR: Axiom, the philosophy society of NSUT, is excited to announce that we're organising a philosophical walk to the Kiran Nadar Museum of Art.

We're not just going to walk around and look at the art masterpieces, we're going to explore the deeper meaning behind it and how it relates to our lives.

We have some fun activities planned for you, from philosophical discussions to interesting games that will challenge the way you perceive the world and life.

Date : 17 August
Time: 11:00 a.m.
Meeting Point: Malviya Nagar Metro Station

Don't worry if you don't know much about art or philosophy, this is a judgement-free zone.

Come with an open mind, willingness to listen and desire to express your thoughts. We're looking forward to seeing you there.
